      Options structure used to configure how often the HTTP receiver polls for
      messages.

      Each of these options is mutually exclusive, except for the `drain`
      boolean. Only one `interval`, `at`, `cron` or `manualPolling` shall be
      present in the options structure.

      This is configured by calling <xref:Client.setOptions> with this as a
      property named `receivePolicy` inside of an <xref:HttpTransportOptions>
      object which is inside of an <xref:DeviceClientOptions> object.
