      A Device Twin is document describing the state of a device that is stored
      by an Azure IoT hub and is available even if the device is offline.

      It is built around 3 sections:
        - Tags: key/value pairs only accessible from the service side
        - Desired Properties: updated by a service and received by the device
        - Reported Properties: updated by the device and received by the service.
      Note that although it is a possibility, desired and reported properties do
      not have to match

      and that the logic to sync these two collections, if necessary, is left to
      the user of the SDK.

      Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins).
